"""Describe the status of a completed task.

Simple and general statuses are defined here, but more of them can be defined
by individual calibrations routines, and user code as well::

    class PinkFirst(Status):
        '''Follow the pink arrow as the next one.'''

    @dataclass
    class ParametrizedException(Status):
        '''Trigger exceptional workflow, passing down a further parameter.

        Useful if the handler function is using some kind of threshold, or can
        make somehow use of the parameter to decide, but in a way that is not
        completely established, so it should not be hardcoded in the status
        type.

        '''
        myvalue: int

    @dataclass
    class ExceptionWithInput(Status):
        '''Pass to next routine as input.'''
        routine_x_input: float

In general, statuses can encode a predetermined decision about what to do next,
so the decision has been handled by the fitting function, or an open decision,
that is left up to the handler function.
