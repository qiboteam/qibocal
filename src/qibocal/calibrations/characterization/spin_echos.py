    """Spin echo calibration routine:
    The two routines are a modified Ramsey sequence with an additional Rx(pi) pulse placed symmetrically between the two Rx(pi/2) pulses.
    The random phases accumulated before and after the pi pulse compensate exactly if the frequency does not change during the sequence.
    After the additional pi rotation the qubit is expected to go always (ideally) to the ground state. An exponential fit to this data
    gives a spin echo decay time T2.
