"""Minimal Qibocal script example.

In this example, the default Qibocal executor is used. Additional
configurations can still be passed through the `init()` call, but there
is no explicit API to access the execution details.

If more fine grained control is needed, refer to the `rx_calibration.py` example.

.. note::

    though simple, this example is not limited to single protocol execution, but
    multiple protocols can be added as well, essentially in the same fashion of a plain
    runcard - still with the advantage of handling execution and results
    programmatically
