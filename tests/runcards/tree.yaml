  description: |
    two main principles are clearly enforced:
    - execution always prefers local threads, so, for as long as it possible to
      follow a single linear sequence, it is done, despite a possible extremely
      low preference of successors
    - when the current thread reaches its end, only priority is used to resume
      the open branches (locality, intended as scope, is used as tie breaker)

    this example intentionally focuses on branching and priority, while no
    merge is involved
